#Delivery Route optimizer

This project implements a delivery route planner application using Python. We have used Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and geopy for geographical calculations. The project aims to allow the users to input a seller's pin code and a delivery pin code to find the optimal delivery route through a fixed paths by using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms. We have used to locations in Coimbatore to find the optimal delivery route.
